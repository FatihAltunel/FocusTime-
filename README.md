FocusTime App
This app is for those who use pomodoro technique for focusing something. It allows you to set a timer for 10, 15 or 20 minutes while you focusing something. If you manage finish the timer then the app will add what you focused on in a list. You are allowed to see your progress on a bar while you are focusing on something or pause it. You can always get back to the main view if you want to.
This is the first app that I develop with the help of my course teacher while I'm learning React Native so further updates may come in the next days!
